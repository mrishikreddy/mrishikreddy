## 💻 Projects

### [SRU Coding Club Website](https://github.com/mrishikreddy/SRU-Coding-Club-Website)
A full-stack web platform for the official coding club of SR University, built using Next.js, React, and Firebase. This platform supports authentication, a leaderboard, AI chatbot integration, and Firestore optimization. It onboarded 500+ users within the first week and uses localStorage caching to reduce Firestore reads by ~80%. I also built **Ciao**, an AI chatbot (powered by Gemini 1.5 Flash) that authenticates college users and answers 3000+ queries daily.

### [Portfolio Website – rishik.tech](https://www.rishik.tech/)
A personal portfolio showcasing my skills and projects, developed using Next.js and hosted on a custom domain. It features a dynamic, real-time contact form and a custom-built AI chatbot assistant powered by Google Gemini API. The site demonstrates advanced full-stack practices and real-world AI integration.

### [Paradise Resort Web App](https://mrishikreddy.github.io/rishik.tech.projects/webApp)
A modern and aesthetic static web application developed for Paradise Resorts using Next.js, HTML, and CSS. It features individual pages for rooms, events, and customer support, providing visitors with an immersive resort booking experience. Achieved a 20% increase in visitor engagement and positive user feedback on design responsiveness.

### [Scholar’s Companion](https://github.com/mrishikreddy/Projects/blob/main/scholars%20companion.c)  
A C-based academic planning utility for students to monitor attendance and estimate required exam marks.

This tool demonstrates algorithmic problem-solving in real-world academic scenarios.

### [Tic Tac Toe AI](https://mrishikreddy.github.io/rishik.tech.projects/ticTacToe)
Developed a Python-based Tic Tac Toe game featuring an AI opponent that uses decision-making algorithms to select optimal moves. The game offers interactive, turn-based gameplay by integrating user inputs with strategic AI responses. Conditional logic and move evaluation techniques were implemented to enhance the AI’s performance, making the game both challenging and engaging.
